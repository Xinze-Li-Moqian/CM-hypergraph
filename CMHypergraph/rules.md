# The rules of this graph

What a node is, what an edge means, and what may appear where. The
mechanical half — text and graph mirroring each other, no undeclared notion,
uniform notation — is enforced by `tools/*_lint.py` rather than left to
habit. None of it is verification: a card can pass every check and still be
false, and the rule that carries the weight — exact match — is judged by a
person. What the checks buy is structural rigidity, which is what makes a
network worth formalizing from.

## 1 · Nodes (atoms)

One card per mathematical statement, filed under `atoms/<type>s/`:
`theorem`, `proposition`, `lemma`, `corollary`, `claim`, `remark`,
`definition`.

id: 7a4b8dc3d01c    sha256 of the normalized Statement — the identity
type: theorem
references:         (optional; provenance is metadata, not content.
  - "[[ref-x|Author, §n]]"   one quoted wikilink per citation — the locus
  - "[[pool-card]]"          in the display text; pool cards bare; a
  - "plain citation"         source without a bibliography card stays a
---                          plain string. Never hashed.)
# Theorem — <content-descriptive title>
<optional intro>      one or two sentences of intuition — what the object
                    looks like and why it exists; provenance belongs in
                    the references frontmatter. Never hashed.
## Statement
## Proof            (folded; absent = status: debt, see § Status)
## Notes            (folded callout like Proof; free commentary, never
                    hashed — background, intuition, figures:
                    ![[assets/*.svg]])
```

- The **id** is the mathematics: it changes exactly when the Statement
  changes. Proof, Notes, links' display text, filenames — none affect it.
- **Names describe content** (`thm-classification-free-product`), never a
  source's numbering. Renaming is free (update inlinks); identity is the id.

## 1b · Pools

The vault holds one curated pool per body of mathematics — `PoincareHypergraph`,
`GMTHypergraph` — beside the raw `cardpool/`. `tools/pools.py` is the single
declaration; every tool reads it, so a new pool is one line there.

- **Which pool a card belongs to**: the one it would still make sense in if
  the others vanished. `def-varifold` survives without Ricci flow;
  `thm-width-evolution` does not. Boundary cases can be left where they land —
  the id hashes the Statement, and a wikilink resolves by filename, so moving
  a card between pools changes neither its identity nor any link to it.
- **Pools do not partition the graph.** Cards cite across pools freely; that
  is the point of keeping one vault rather than one repository per subject.
- **An edge lives with its SOURCE.** It is the source's assertion that its
  statement or proof consumes the target, and the target may well be in
  another pool.

## 2 · Edges

One file per edge, filed under `edges/<kind>/`, named `<source>→<target>`:

| kind | meaning | witnessed by |
|---|---|---|
| `uses` | the source's **proof** consumes the target result | a `[[link]]` in the Proof |
| `depends` | the source's **statement** builds on the target result | a `[[link]]` in the Statement |
| `references` | the target is a **definition** the source's text invokes | a `[[link]]` anywhere in Statement/Proof |

- **Text-mirror rule**: every edge is witnessed by a link and every link
  demands an edge — no phantom edges, no silent citations (`edge_lint`).
- **Exact-match rule**: an edge's target states *precisely* what the source
  consumes. If the available card proves something adjacent, insert the
  missing statement as its own card between them.
- An edge's id is `sha256(kind : source-id : target-id)` — it changes
  exactly when the relation or either endpoint's mathematics changes.

## 3 · Status: the three states of a statement

Every non-definition atom carries a `status:` property, computed by
`tools/frontier.py` from two checks — *does the card have a Proof
section?* and *do its Statement/Proof link into `cardpool/`?*

| status | definition | canvas |
|---|---|---|
| `debt` | no `## Proof` section | red |
| `open` | proof present, but the Statement/Proof cites at least one raw-pool card | magenta |
| `proved` | proof present and every citation stays inside the clean pool (or is a declared ground notion) | type colour |

Transitions: `debt` → (write the proof) → `open` or `proved`;
`open` → (graduate the pool cards it cites) → `proved`.

Definition and remark cards carry no status — neither has anything to prove.
Notes never affect status: a pool link in Notes is a soft pointer, not a
dependency.

## 4 · Where a concept may live

Every mathematical notion is in exactly one of three places:

1. **Definition card** (`atoms/definitions/`) — defines and *only* defines;
   a definition card never carries a theorem.
2. **Fact card** — any true statement, however small
   ($\pi_1(S^3/\Gamma) \cong \Gamma$), is a lemma/proposition with its
   own proof and id; facts
   are never smuggled into definitions or asides.
3. **Ground notion** — a declared primitive, listed in
   [[notation]] § Ground notions.

Anything in none of the three is an undeclared debt.

## 5 · Language

- **Statement and Proof are mathematics only** — no author names, no
  cf./see, no chapter pointers, no bibliography (`noise_lint`); prose in
  Let/Then form; key terms link their definition cards at first occurrence.
  A link alias must contain no math (`$…$` in an alias renders raw) — put
  the link on a plain word: `$S^2$-[[def-s2-bundle-over-s1|bundle]]`.
- **[[notation]] is normative**: one name and one symbol per concept,
  registered at graduation time.
- Statement templates: displayed formula (classification), itemized list
  (reassembly), enumerated conclusions (surgery flow). Proof styles:
  numbered steps for linear derivations, bold part headings for proofs in
  named parts, a single paragraph for one-move proofs; always end $\square$.
- **Every concept links at first occurrence.** In a Statement or Proof, a
  term with a definition card carries a `[[link]]` the first time it
  appears; later bare repeats in the same section are fine. `tools/term_lint.py`
  lists candidates (advisory — it cannot judge compounds).
- **A citation must be supported.** A proof cites `[[card]]` together with
  its *instantiation*: which objects here play the cited statement's data,
  and why its hypotheses hold at this point of the argument. What the
  citation yields is then *displayed* as a formula or stated symbolically
  — never paraphrased loosely. Prose that narrates ("the flow is repaired
  and continues") without a supported citation behind it is a defect.

## 6 · Growth

The graph grows by **graduation** from `cardpool/` (see FRONTIER.md for
proof debts and the citation frontier): refine the statement, name it by
content, wire the edges, mark the pool original `graduated: <stem>`.
Checks, all of which must print clean:

```
python3 tools/assign_ids.py     ids (idempotent)
python3 tools/render_lint.py    tex→Obsidian rendering
python3 tools/noise_lint.py     no bibliographic noise in the mathematics
python3 tools/edge_lint.py      edges ⇔ text
```
